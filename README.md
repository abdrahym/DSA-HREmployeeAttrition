# Solving Human Resources Issues

## Business Understanding
Jaya Jaya Maju is a multinational company that has been operating since 2000 and has more than 1,000 employees scattered throughout Indonesia. As a large company, Jaya Jaya Maju certainly has the need to maintain the stability and productivity of its workforce in order to remain competitive in the market. One important aspect of human resource management is the employee retention rate. Unfortunately, despite the company's rapid growth, they face serious challenges in maintaining that retention rate, marked by a fairly high attrition rate, which is over 10%.

### Business Issues
The high attrition rate risks reducing productivity, increasing recruitment and training costs for new employees, and can affect the morale and overall performance of the team. HR management does not yet have an effective monitoring system to analyze the patterns and factors influencing employee turnover. Without a proper understanding of the root causes of attrition, efforts to reduce these numbers become inefficient and reactive.
